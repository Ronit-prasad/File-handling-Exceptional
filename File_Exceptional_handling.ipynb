        "1: What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "  - Compiled languages:\n",
        "    - Code is translated into machine code before execution using a compiler.\n",
        "    - Errors are detected before running the program.\n",
        "    - Example: C, C++, Rust\n",
        "  - Interpreted Languages:\n",
        "    - Code is translated line-by-line during execution by an interpreter.\n",
        "    - Errors are detected while running stopping execution if an issue occurs.\n",
        "    - Example: Python, Javascript, Ruby.\n",
        "\n",
        "2: What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "  - Exception handling is a mechanism in python that allows a program to handle errors gracefully instead of crashing when something goes wrong. It is done using try-except blocks.\n",
        "\n",
        "3: What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "  - The finally block in python is used to specify a block of code that alaways executes, regardless of wheather an exception occurs or not. It is mainly used for cleanup operations, such as closing files.\n",
        "\n",
        "4: What is logging in Python?\n",
        "  - Logging in python is a way to track events that happens while a program runs. It helps in debugging, monitoring and recording important infoemation about the program's execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "5: What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "  - The __del__ method is a destructor in python, called automatically when an object is about to be destroyed. It is used for cleanup tasks like closing files, releasing memory or disconnecting from a database.\n",
        "\n",
        "6: What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "  - Import:\n",
        "    - Imports the entire module.\n",
        "    - You must use the module name when accessing functions or variables.\n",
        "  - from ...import:\n",
        "    - Imports specific functions, classes or variables from a module.\n",
        "    - You can use them directly without the module name.\n",
        "\n",
        "7:  How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "  - In python you can handle multiple exceptions using different approaches to ensure your program doesn't crash unexpectedly.\n",
        "  - You can handle different exceptions separately using multiple except blocks.\n",
        "  - If multiple exceptions require the same handling you can group them in a tuple.\n",
        "\n",
        "8: What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "  - The with statment is used when working with files to ensure proper resource management. It automatically closes the file once theblock of code is executed, even if an error occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "9: What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "  - Multithreading:\n",
        "    - Threads share the same memory space\n",
        "    - Best for I/O-bound tasks\n",
        "    - limited by GIL in python, which prevents true parellel execution.\n",
        "    - Example: File operations, API calls\n",
        "  - Multiprocessing:\n",
        "    - Each process runs indepently with seperate memory.\n",
        "    - best for CPU-bound tasks\n",
        "    - Bypasses GIL enabling real parallel execution.\n",
        "    - Example: Image processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "10: What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "  - Logging is an essential tool for tracking, debugging and monitoring a program's execution. Instread of relying on print() statments, logging provides a structured way to record events, errors and performance data.\n",
        "\n",
        "11: What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "  - Memory management in python refers to the process of allocating, tracking. and freeing memory during program execution. Python automatically handles memory managemnet using techniques like reference counting.\n",
        "\n",
        "12: What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "  - There are 4 basic steps in exception handling:\n",
        "   - Use try block to detect errors\n",
        "   - use except block to handle errors\n",
        "   - Use else block for code that runs if no exception occurs.\n",
        "   - Use finally blcok for cleanup\n",
        "\n",
        "13: Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "  - memory management is crucial in python to ensure efficient resource utilization, prevent memory leaks, and optimize program performance. Since python automatically handles memory allocation and deallocation its importance helps developers write more efficient code.\n",
        "\n",
        "14: What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "  - Role of try Block:\n",
        "    - The try block contains code that migght raise an exception\n",
        "    - If an error occurs, execution jumps to the corresponding except block.\n",
        "    - If no error occurs, the except block is skipped.\n",
        "  - Role of except Block:\n",
        "    - The except block handles the error that occurs inside the try block.\n",
        "    - You can catch specific exceptions or use a general exception handler.\n",
        "\n",
        "15: How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "  - Python's garbage collection system automatically manages memory by reclaming unused objects to prevent memory leaks and optimize performance. It mainly relies on refernece counting and a cyclic garbage collector to free memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "16: What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "  - In python. the else block in exception handling is used to execute code that should only run if no exceptions occur in the try block.\n",
        "    - Executes only if the try block runs successfully.\n",
        "    - Skips execution if an exception is raised and handled in except.\n",
        "\n",

        "    - Gaebage collection overhead:\n",
        "     - Python uses garbage collection to free up unused memory, but it adds processing overhead.\n",
        "     - Example: Manual garbage collection.\n",
        "    - Memory leaks:\n",
        "      - A memory leaks happens when objects are not properly released, leading to increased memory usage.\n",
